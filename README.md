# Temperature-Monitoring-in-CMD-of-windows-from-Arduino-UART-Communication---DHT11
In this project we can get data displayed from arduino DHT11 sensor via serial communication

We are using serial, time, keyboard, os, winsound modules in the project. We will get data from the Arduino via serial communication using a USB cable, Data from the DHT11 sensor is directly read by the python code. 

In the code we are displying temperature and humidity status in text also based on the screen color. Above the threshold program will make windows to beep using winsound.
